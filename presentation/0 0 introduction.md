Jeff Knupp in his book “Writing Idiomatic Python”, states that;

> We may document our code extensively, write exhaustive unit tests,
> and hold code reviews three times a day, but the fact remains: when 
> someone else needs to make changes, the code is king

Python has code style guidelines and idioms. Idioms in a programming language let future readers know exactly what we’re trying to do
